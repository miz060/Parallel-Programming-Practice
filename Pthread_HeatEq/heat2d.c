/*
  Purpose:
      MAIN is the main program for HEATED_PLATE.
  Discussion:
      This code solves the steady state heat equation on a rectangular region.

      The physical region, and the boundary conditions, are suggested
      by this diagram;

      U = Tt
      +------------------+
      |                  |
      U = Tl	|                  | U = Tr 
      |                  |
      +------------------+
      U = Tb

      The region is covered with a grid of M by N nodes, and an N by N
      array U is used to record the temperature.  

      The steady state solution to the discrete heat equation satisfies the
      following condition at an interior grid point:

      U[Central] = (1/4) * ( U[North] + U[South] + U[East] + U[Uest] )

      where "Central" is the index of the grid point, "North" is the index
      of its immediate neighbor to the "north", and so on.

      Given an approximate solution of the steady state heat equation, a
      "better" solution is given by replacing each interior point by the
      average of its 4 neighbors - in other words, by using the condition
      as an ASSIGNMENT statement:

      U[Central]  <=  (1/4) * ( U[North] + U[South] + U[East] + U[Uest] )

      If this process is repeated often enough, the difference 
      between successive estimates of the solution will go to zero.

      This program carries out such an iteration, using a tolerance specified by
      the user, and writes the final estimate of the solution to a file that can
      be used for graphic processing.
